# burger

Thank you for visiting the burger page. This page was created as a way to test our skills with being abl to run a live full stack developed page with a database. During this excercise, the user creates a new "Burger", which is then created on the online SQL database, and then the user can "Devour" the burger, which changes a boolean value from true to false, which then moves that burger to a new section of the website. This is meainly using the CRU part of the CRUD format. The database is stored online through JAWSDB. The link is below:
